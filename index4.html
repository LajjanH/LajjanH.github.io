When you walk north through the Mithril Forges and into the Chamber of Mazarbul you meet many dwarves and all are kind. 
A bit suspicious, but as long you are no orc it's alright. In the Chamber of Mazarbul you see a beautiful painting along with its scripture.


The Fathers of the Dwarves were the first of their race.
<br><br>

The eldest of all, Durin, lay alone at Mount Gundabad in the north of the Misty Mountains. 
He later founded the line of the Longbeards, the Dwarves which were most friendly to the Elves and Men, mostly referred to as Durin's Folk. 
He founded Khazad-dûm.
<br><br>

Two others were laid to rest in the Ered Luin or Blue Mountains, 
and they founded the lines of the Broadbeams and the Firebeards who later lived in Nogrod and Belegost. 
The other four Fathers of the Dwarves were laid to rest in two pairs in Rhûn; lands at least as far east of Mount Gundabad as it lay east of the Blue Mountains. 
They founded the lines of the Ironfists, Stiffbeards, Blacklocks, and Stonefoots.

<br><br>

Durin lived to a great age, even by the measure of the Dwarves, 
until he was known as -the Deathless-. The Longbeards believed that Durin would return seven times, and each time he will again be named Durin and reign as King.

The world was young, the mountains green,<br>
No stain yet on the Moon was seen,<br>
No words were laid on stream or stone,<br>
When Durin woke and walked alone.<br>
He named the nameless hills and dells,<br>
He drank from yet untasted wells,<br>
He stooped and looked in Mirrormere,<br>
And saw a crown of stars appear,<br>
As gems upon a silver thread,<br>
Above the shadow of his head.<br><br>
The world was fair, the mountains tall, <br>
In Elder Days before the fall<br> 
Of mighty Kings in Nargothrond,<br>
And Gondolin, who now beyond<br> 
The Western Seas have passed away. <br>
The world was fair in Durin's Day.<br><br>
A king he was on carven throne<br>
In many-pillared halls of stone<br>
With golden roof and silver floor,<br>
And runes of power upon the door. <br>
The light of sun and star and moon<br>
In shining lamps of crystal hewn<br>
Undimmed by cloud or shade of night<br>
There shown forever far and bright.

There hammer on the anvil smote,<br>
There chisel clove, and graver wrote;<br>
There forged was blade, and bound was hilt;<br>
The delver mined, the mason built.<br>
There beryl, pearl, and opal pale,<br>
And metal wrought like fishes' mail,<br>
Buckler and corslet, axe and sword,<br>
And shining spears were laid in hoard.<br><br>

Unwearied then were Durin's folk;<br>
Beneath the mountains music woke:<br>
The harpers harped, the minstrels sang,<br>
And at the gates the trumpets rang.<br>

The world is grey, the mountains old,<br>
The forge's fire is ashen-cold;<br>
No harp is wrung, no hammer falls:<br>
The darkness dwells in Durin's halls;<br>
The shadow lies upon his tomb<br>
In Moria, in Khazad-dûm.<br>
But still the sunken stars appear<br>
In dark and windless Mirrormere;<br>
There lies his crown in water deep,<br>
Till Durin wakes again from sleep.
