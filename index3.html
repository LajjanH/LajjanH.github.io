The door has open and you've walked in. There is no light and you hear no sound.  
Deep in it's pitch black but in the hallway you see an opening in the wall to the right. 
There within lays a big metal box, but the box has a code lock on it.
The inscription on the box says:
<br><br>

For thee whom mellon is, help there is to find. Speak his name, for the father is kind.

  <div class="scroll-div" id="textBox2">
    <div class="scroll-object">
The box has opened! In the box you see a pile of maps, torches, and a note:
<br><br>

If you read this, please be aware. We lived in peace for a long time, 
but nothing last forever. We tried to hold them back, but we could not. We were overrun by orcs. We who speak of Khuzdul still live in Khaza-dum, 
but we are not alone. The southern parts of Khaza-dum were given up and the northern were kept. Take a torch and a map. Please be safe.
<br><br>

*You take on of each and lock the box again.

Khazad-dûm was a huge array of chambers, passages, mines, halls, stores and pits. In general, areas were either classed as mines or city. 
The mines were working sections of Khazad-dûm whilst the city was the area of habitation.
<br><br>

The city areas of Khazad-dûm were clustered primarily to the east; these were the oldest parts of the kingdom and had access to the Great Gates. 
They were structured into seven Levels and seven Deeps. The Levels stretched above the gate whilst the Deeps were set deeper within the mountain 
below the level of the East-gate. It is possible that the First Level (on which the Great Gates were set) and the First Deep were highly intertwined.
<br><br>

The eastern section of the city spaces had also been delved in such a manner as to have light shafts to illuminate their chambers. 
One example of this is the Chamber of Mazarbul which was located on the eastern edge of the Seventh Level.
<br><br>

Follow the map but be aware of the trolls and orcs. Find the path to the Eastern gate. First you have to go through:
