    You have just woken up in a tavern. The drunken bastard that you are have been drinking for the last 3 days, and spending coin that is not yours.
      <br></br>
    You borrowed coin from a group of dunedain. they left a note with the inkeeper - "meet us in dimrill dale in a weeks time with what you owe us".
      <br></br> 
    You neither have the time to go round he misty mountains nor the  coins. Your mind goes to the roumor of the treasures in Khaza-dum. 
    If you took that way you will be there in time and maybe procure som coin.</p>

This is a beta version of the game and my first programming project. The game is Tolkien inspired with a lot of made up stuff about the fourth age. 
<br><br>
You have 60 minutes to finish the game and reach Dimrill Dale. Have fun!
